# MNIST-Project

## Overview
The MNIST-Project is designed to explore and analyze the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. This project aims to build and evaluate various machine learning models for digit classification.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Visualization of the dataset
- Implementation of different machine learning models
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Frizonplay/MNIST-Project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd MNIST-Project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. To start exploring the dataset, run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `MNIST.ipynb` notebook to visualize and preprocess the data, train and evaluate models.

## Results
Model Accuracy:
- Training Accuracy: 99.67%
- Validation Accuracy: 99.43%
- Test Accuracy: 99.582%
### Sample Predictions:
